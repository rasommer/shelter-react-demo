# Shelter React Demo

This is an example of application using React. It was presented for challenge project. I've used context to study its behaviour. The project is a simple application to manage a shelter. It is possible to add, remove and list donations. The donations are stored in the local storage. Just reload the page to return to the initial state.

## Running

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
